## What is this? 

A silly macOS game built in SwiftUI (that means it will only work on macOS Catalina). 
I built it so I can learn how to code in SwiftUI.

## What does it do?

How about a GIF...

## Credits

This game is based on a [SwiftUI tutorial by Audrey Tam](https://www.raywenderlich.com/3715234-swiftui-getting-started) which originally targets iPhone apps. Because SwiftUI is awesome I was able to use the same principles for building it to run on macOS.
